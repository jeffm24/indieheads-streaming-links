# Universal Streaming Links for /r/indieheads and /r/hiphopheads

A lightweight userscript made to be used with the Tampermonkey extension that grabs links to various streaming services 
from [SongLink](https://song.link) and embeds them directly into the page. Works on the comments pages of posts with [FRESH*] tags 
in [/r/indieheads](https://reddit.com/r/indieheads) and [/r/hiphopheads](https://reddit.com/r/hiphopheads).

## Usage
1. Install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your browser of choice.
2. Install the [script](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/jeffm24/IndieheadsHiphopheads_Streaming_Links) (see [here](https://github.com/OpenUserJS/OpenUserJS.org/wiki/Tampermonkey-for-Chrome#installing-userscripts) for a guide on how to install scripts from OpenUserJS).
3. Once installed, you should see the 'All Streaming Links' link added next to the post title on all comments pages with [FRESH*] in the post title (if any links were found).
